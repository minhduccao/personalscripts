        Your hands are **NOT** too small. Check out [Madhi Gilbert, who can perform cardistry without hands,](https://youtu.be/4FtCU7GAjtw) or [any](https://redd.it/8oxbnx) [of](https://youtu.be/gqyW3F7EZ5g?t=4m10s) [these](https://youtu.be/iIsiBCXYAP4?t=39s) [cardists](https://www.instagram.com/lukas_rebele/).

        You may need to practice more, try different grips or try using less cards to get there (avoid bridge-size cards if possible). Some moves will be harder without larger hands, but **most moves out there are possible with enough effort and patience.**

        If you're just starting out and the move you came up with is simple, uses basic mechanics, or is a combination of simpler moves, there's a pretty good chance that it is NOT original. It doesn't mean that the move is inherently bad, it just means that someone else came up with it before you did (if it is unoriginal). That doesn't mean you should stop trying to create new moves either -- just realize that it might take a while for you to come up with something truly original. Good moves take time, so don't try to rush it either :)

        Of course, if your move is legitimately original, don't forget that originality isn't the only thing that makes a move great. The mechanics/concepts, visual appeal, and execution are just as, if not more, important than its originality.
